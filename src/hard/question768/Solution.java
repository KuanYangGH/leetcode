 * Max Chunks To Make Sorted II
 * This question is the same as "Max Chunks to Make Sorted" except the integers of
 * the given array are not necessarily distinct,the input array could be up to length 2000,
 * and the elements could be up to 10**8.
 * Given an array arr of integers (not necessarily distinct), we split the array into some number
 * of "chunks" (partitions), and individually sort each chunk.  After concatenating them,
 * the result equals the sorted array.
